# Redux Crash Course

I built this from Traversy Media's Redux Crash Course [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93p3LxR9xfM&t=129s) and [repo](https://github.com/bradtraversy/redux_crash_course).

I added Tailwind, and I used function based views and hooks instead of class based views.

## Todos

  - Use an interactive server; jsonplaceholder is great, but I needed to get creative with the "add post" functionality.
  - Replace `fetch()` with `axios`.
